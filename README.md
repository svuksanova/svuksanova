### 🧩 About Me
 
- 🌍 Based somewhere between logic and creativity  
- 🔎 I love figuring out how things work — then making them better  
- ⚡ Sometimes I build apps, sometimes I automate life, sometimes I just vibe  
- 🧪 Into experimenting with tech, ideas, and side quests that lead somewhere unexpected  
- 🧘‍♂️ Currently balancing code, chaos, and caffeine  


### ✨ Fun Facts

- I write better code at 2am 🌙  
- Dark mode is not a preference, it's a lifestyle 🌚
